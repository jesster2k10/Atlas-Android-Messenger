# Atlas Messenger for Android

Atlas Messenger is a fully-featured messaging app following [Material Design guidelines](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html#introduction-goals), built on top of the [Layer SDK](https://layer.com/), using the [Atlas UI toolkit](https://github.com/layerhq/Atlas-Android).

## <a name="structure"></a>Structure

* **App:** Application class.
* Activities:
  * **BaseActivity:** Base Activity class for handling menu titles and the menu back button and ensuring the `LayerClient` is connected when resuming Activities.
  * **ConversationsListActivity:** List of all Conversations for the authenticated user.
  * **MessagesListActivity:** List of Messages within a particular Conversation.  Also handles message composition and addressing.
  * **SettingsActivity:** Global application settings.
  * **ConversationDetailsActivity:** Settings for a particular Conversation.
* **PushNotificationReceiver:** Handles `com.layer.sdk.PUSH` Intents and displays notifications.
* **AuthenticationProvider:** Interface used by the Messenger app to authenticate users.  Default implementations are provided by gradle `flavors`; see *Build Variants* below.

## <a name="identityproviders"></a>Identity Providers

Atlas Messenger uses the `AuthenticationProvider` interface to authenticate with various backends.  Additional identity providers can integrate with Atlas Messenger by implementing `AuthenticationProvider` and using a custom login Activity, similar to the provided flavors below.

### <a name="buildvariants"></a>Provided Flavors
Two default implementations are provided via [product flavors](http://developer.android.com/tools/building/configuring-gradle.html#workBuildVariants), where each flavor implements a custom `AuthenticationProvider`, a custom Atlas `Participant`, and provides login Activities for gathering their required credentials:  

1. **atlasprovider:** For use in the [Layer Atlas demo](https://getatlas.layer.com/android).  This authentication flow utilizes a QR-Code scanner to capture a Layer App ID from the Layer developer dashboard.  The scanner can be bypassed by supplying your Atlas demo App ID in the `App.LAYER_APP_ID` constant. 
2. **herokuprovider:** For use with the deployable [Rails Provider](https://github.com/layerhq/layer-identity-provider) backend.  Your Layer App ID must be set in the `App.LAYER_APP_ID` constant.

In Android Studio, switch flavors using Build Variants, typically in the side tab on the lower left of the Android Studio window.

### <a name="pushnotifications"></a>Push Notifications

In order to build Atlas-Messenger, you must generate a `google-services.json` file so push notifications will be enabled. If this is not done, the Gradle build will fail with the error: `File google-services.json is missing. The Google Services Plugin cannot function without it.`

To do this, please follow the push notification setup steps [here](https://docs.layer.com/sdk/android/push). You may also remove the `google-services` plugin in the necessary `build.gradle` files to disable push notifications.
